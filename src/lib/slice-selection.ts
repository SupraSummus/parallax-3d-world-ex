/**
 * Slice selection: decides which slices of a face's layers (view.ts) the
 * camera renders, how they are split into chunks, and along which
 * direction each chunk is baked. Depths count layers, LAYER apart.
 *
 * A slice is a slab of a face's layers between two layers of a coarser
 * lattice 2^k·FCC (k its level), made of the cells of a finer one 2^ℓ·FCC
 * (its atoms, cells.ts) that have their own site in the slab, drawn as
 * the voxels of the world's grid of level ℓ. Up to level ATOM_SHIFT the
 * atoms are single voxels and a slab is 2^k layers of them; above, a slab
 * is 2^ATOM_SHIFT layers of coarser voxels. In grid ℓ's units a slice is
 * one of level k − ℓ: slices are the same at every scale. Voxels of
 * neighbouring layers interlock, so the slab's voxels span a little more
 * than its 2^k layers; its centre plane, where its chunks are baked and
 * drawn, is the middle of that.
 *
 * Constraints (see docs/architecture.md for the derivation and worked examples):
 *
 * 1. Occlusion (physical). A slice is drawn flat, so a thick slice can show
 *    geometry that true perspective hides. A slice at viewing distance d at
 *    most d / detail thick, with detail = leakFreeDetail(...), never shows
 *    more than the `max leak` angle of it. Far voxels are small on
 *    screen, so slices grow with distance and covering distance n takes
 *    O(detail · log n) slices.
 *
 * 2. Caching. A slice is named by its level and its slab (and its cutoff,
 *    see SliceId) wherever the camera is, so it always has the same content
 *    and can be cached.
 *
 * Walking away from the camera, each level takes over once its slices are
 * thin enough there. Slabs of levels with the same atoms nest; where the
 * atoms grow, cells of the two sizes do not nest, so the last slices of the
 * nearer level hold only the sites whose cell one size up lies before
 * where the next level begins.
 *
 * Slices are split in x and y into chunks: bricks (chunkCell), each the
 * shadow along the axis of a column of cells of a coarser lattice still.
 * The chunks of a level are baked in perspective from its eye (eyeOf), the
 * site of the level's lattice whose cell holds the camera. The closer the
 * eye is to the camera for the slices' distance, the thicker they may be.
