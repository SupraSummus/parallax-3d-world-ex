# Parallax Voxel Engine

A proof of concept that renders a 3D voxel world (rhombic dodecahedra on
the face-centred cubic lattice) as a stack of cached 2D
depth slices composited with WebGL. Slices get thicker with
distance, but never so thick that they show more than a few pixels of what
true perspective would hide; camera movement mostly just moves cached
images.

Live demo: <https://suprasummus.github.io/parallax-world/> (deployed from `main`).

## Quick start

Chunks are baked by Rust compiled to WebAssembly (`bake/`),
so besides Node and pnpm you need [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
with its WebAssembly target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Controls: W/S forward/back, A/D left/right, Space/Shift up/down, arrow
keys or drag to look around.
"Open in 3D Viewer" shows the same scene with a conventional (three.js)
renderer and an orbit camera.

Other scripts (`test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `knip`, `build`) are in
`package.json`.
