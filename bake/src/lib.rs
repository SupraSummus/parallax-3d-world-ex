//! Chunk baking, compiled to WebAssembly for the bake workers: the voxel
//! faces of a chunk cell, projected from an eye onto its slice's centre
//! plane and filled into pixels. A world is a grid per level of detail;
//! each slice reads the one its atoms are the voxels of (in_grid).
//! chunk-baker.ts drives it through the
//! exports at the bottom. See docs/architecture.md, section 3.
//! The same module finds what nearer layers cover on the main thread
//! (coverage.rs).
