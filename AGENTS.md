# Agent Development Guide

Entry point for AI agents working on this codebase. Read this first.

## Documents

| Document | Purpose | Read when |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| [README.md](README.md) | Overview and quick start | First |
| [docs/product.md](docs/product.md) | What the product does and doesn't do | Adding or changing features |
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | Slicing, caching and compositing architecture | Touching `src/lib` |
| [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) | Test layout and conventions | Writing tests |
| [docs/todo.md](docs/todo.md) | Measured or derived improvements not done yet | Looking for what to do next |
| [docs/generators.md](docs/generators.md) | Generating worlds in pieces: layers, things, rules | Writing or changing a world generator |

Each concept has one home:
build/test commands live in `package.json` scripts,
architecture in `docs/architecture.md`,
product behaviour in `docs/product.md`,
test conventions in `docs/testing.md`,
planned work in `docs/todo.md`,
agent rules here.
Link instead of duplicating.
Docs go in `docs/` with lower-case names;
only conventional files (README, AGENTS, LICENSE) stay at the root.

## Workflow

Before and after changing code, run the `package.json` scripts and fix
errors (lint warnings are advisory):

```bash
pnpm check   # lint, typecheck, knip, knip:production, then test
```

`pnpm test` takes most of that time.
While iterating, run only the affected test files
([docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md));
run `pnpm check` again only after changing code.

`pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` cover the Rust in `bake/` too
(clippy with warnings as errors, rustfmt, `cargo test`);
`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` rebuild its WebAssembly first.
CI runs the same scripts plus `pnpm build`. For rendering changes, also look
at the result in the browser (`pnpm dev`); unit tests can't see pixels.

## Rules

1. **No dangling files.** Every file is imported, referenced by config, or
   linked from this file or README.md. When removing a file, remove its
   references. `knip` enforces this for code.
2. **Minimal docs.** Prefer code comments for implementation details. Delete
   outdated docs rather than letting them mislead. When changing code, grep
   the docs for mentions and update them.
3. **Architecture changes** update `docs/architecture.md` and the affected
   tests.
4. **TypeScript strict** (`strictTypeChecked` ESLint rules). Follow existing
   patterns in neighbouring files.
5. **Semantic line breaks in Markdown** ([sembr.org](https://sembr.org/)).
   One sentence per line,
   and break after a clause where it helps (comma, semicolon, colon, dash).
   Keep lines under about 80 characters, except for links and code.
   Apply it lazily: to paragraphs you write or edit, no mass reformatting.
